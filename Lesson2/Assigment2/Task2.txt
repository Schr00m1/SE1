the output of t.display() logically will be 23 since a there is 23

but of testEx it will also be 23 we didnt override the display function in testEx and when setting a as string in testEx it only hides the value of the a = 23 in test
but when we call the diplay of Test then it recognoizes the 23 again and therefore the output of testEx.display() is also 23
if we would want to make it output the string we would need to override the display method in testEx
